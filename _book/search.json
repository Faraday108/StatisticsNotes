Who loves writing exhaustive definitions in a notebook or copying figures when instead we could have an already prepared framework to speed note taking of important concepts?\nI’m starting this in the middle of a school year, having recently come back from paternity leave so the beginning of this book will need to be updated later. Instead, I’ll begin with the section we are examining currently - the beginning of Chapter 5 - Continuous Random Variables.",

There are many continuous probability distributions that fit different situations best. We will discuss the normal, exponential, and uniform distributions and work example problems from the uniform distribution.",
