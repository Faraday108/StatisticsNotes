The heights are **continuous** since height is measured. \n\nThe following histogram displays the height on the $x$-axis and the relative frequency on the $y$-axis. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2.2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-1-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Frequency Polygons \n\n* Analogous to line graphs \n* Good for overlaying data\n* Data is divided into a number of intervals (think bins from histograms), giving $x$ values \n* Find frequency of data within each interval, giving $y$ values \n* Plot points for each interval, draw line segments to connect them. \n\n### Example 2 \n\nThe following frequency polygon was constructed by looking at the distribution of Calculus final test scores. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2.2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-2-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan separate out different data categories and lay on top: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2.2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-3-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Time Series Graph \n\n* Suppose we want to study temperature of a region for an entire month. \n* One feature we may want to consider is time. Since date is paired with temperature, we can use time as an axis. \n* We use both pieces of the paired data to construct the graph - one axis for time, one axis for data value. Typically points are connected by lines in order of occurrence. \n\n### Example 3 \n\nThe following time series shows the number unemployed (in thousands) on the $y$-axis, and the date on the $x$-axis. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2.2_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-4-1.pdf)\n:::\n:::\n",
