Josie draws one marble from the bag at random, records the color, and replaces the marble. \n\n**Q1** The probability of drawing blue is: \n\nThen Josie draws a marble from the bag a second time. \n\n**Q2** The probability of drawing blue the second time is: \n\n*Note*: if it not known whether $A$ and $B$ are independent or dependent, assume they are dependent until you can show otherwise. \n\n## Mutually Exclusive Events \n\n$A$ and $B$ are **mutually exclusive** if the cannot occur at the same time. That is, they do not share any outcomes and $P(A \\text{ AND } B)=0$\n\n### Examples \n\n1. What is an example of mutually exclusive events for flipping a coin? \n\n\\vspace{2em}\n\n2. What is an example of mutually exclusive events for drawing a card from a standard 52 card deck? \n\n\\vspace{2em}\n\n## In-Class Problems \n\n\\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=2em, topsep=1em]\n\\item Flip two fair coins. Find the probabilities of the events: \n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Let $F=$ the event of getting at most one tail. \n\\item Let $G=$ the event of getting two faces that are the same \n\\item Let $H=$ the event of getting a head on the first flip followed by a head or tail on the second flip. \n\\item Are $F$ and $G$ mutually exclusive? \n\\item Let $J=$ the event of getting all tails. Are $J$ and $H$ mutually exclusive \n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\item A student goes to the library. Let events $B=$ the student checks out a book and $D=$ the student checks out a DVD. Suppose that $P(B)=0.40$, $P(D)=0.30$, and $P(B \\text{ AND }D)=0.20$ \n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Find $P(B|D)$ \n\\vspace{2em}\n\\item Find $P(D|B)$ \n\\vspace{2em}\n\\item Are $B$ an $D$ independent? \n\n\\item Are $B$ and $D$ mutually exclusive? \n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\item A box has two balls, one white and one red. We select one ball, put it back in the box, and select a second ball (sampling with replacement). Find the probability of the following events. \n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Let $F=$ the event of getting the white ball twice\n\\vspace{2em}\n\\item Let $G=$ the event of getting two balls of different colors \n\\vspace{2em}\n\\item Let $H=$ the event of getting white on the first pick \n\\vspace{2em}\n\\item Are $F$ and $G$ mutually exclusive? \n\\item Are $G$ and $H$ mutually exclusive? \n\\end{enumerate}\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n## Homework \n\n1. $E$ and $F$ are mutually exclusive events. $P(E)=0.4; P(F)=0.5$. Find $P(E|F)$ \n2. $J$ and $K$ are independent events. $P(J|K)=0.3$. Find $P(J)$ \n3. $U$ and $V$ are mutually exclusive events. $P(U)=0.26; P(V)=0.37$. Find the following: \n    a. $P(U \\text{ AND } V)$\n    b. $P(U|V)$ \n    c. $P(U \\text{ OR }V)$ \n4. $Q$ and $R$ are independent events. $P(Q)=0.4$ and $P(Q \\text{ AND }R)=0.1$. Find $P(R)$ \n",
