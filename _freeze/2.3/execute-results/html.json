This is because our by-hand method takes the average of the two values on either side of the calculated index, while R interpolates between them. \n\n### Finding the percentile of a value in a data set\n\n* Let's say I got an 83 on a test and I want to know what my percentile was. \n* Let $x$ = the number of data values from the bottom of the data up to (not including) the value I want to find the percentile at \n* Let $y$ = the number of data values equal to the data value for which you want to find the percentile \n* Let $n$ = the total number of data points \n* The percentile of a value is then: $\\frac{x+.5y}{n}\\cdot(100)$ rounded to nearest integer. \n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n### Example 4\nListed are 29 ages for Academy Award-winning best actors in order from smallest to largest:\n18, 21, 22, 25, 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 33, 36, 37, 41, 42, 47, 52, 55, 57, 58, 62, 64, 67, 69, 71, 72, 73, 74, 76, 77 \n\na.
