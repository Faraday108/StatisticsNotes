Rachel, a student in the class, ran one mile in 8 minutes. \nA junior high school class ran one mile with a mean of nine minutes and a standard deviation of two minutes. Kenji, a student in the class, ran one mile in 8.5 minutes. \nA high school class ran one mile with a mean of seven minutes and a standard deviation of four minutes. Nedda, a student in the class, ran one mile in eight minutes. \n\na. Why is Kenji considered a better runner than Nedda even through Nedda ran faster? \n\n\\vspace{5em}\n\nb. Who is the fastest runner with respect to their class? \n\n\\vspace{5em} \n\n## Calculating the standard deviation \n\n* If $x$ is a number, then $x-mean$ is called its *deviation* \n* In a data set, there are as many deviations as data points, the deviations together are used to calculate the standard deviation \n    * In a **population**: the deviation is $x-\\mu$ \n    * In a **sample**: the deviation is $x-\\bar x$ \n* To find standard deviation, first find **variance**: the average of the squares of deviations (have to square deviations, otherwise they add up to 0!) \n    * Population variance: $\\sigma^2=\\frac{\\sum (x-\\mu)^2}{N}$\n    * Sample variance: $s^2=\\frac{\\sum(x-\\bar x)^2}{n-1}$\n        * Note we use $n-1$ instead of $N$ for the sample variance. You can think of this as we need to account for $\\bar x$ being an estimate of $\\mu$ which effectively means our estimate is less certain. \n\nFinally, to get standard deviation, square root the variance: \n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sigma&=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum(x-\\mu)^2}{N}} \\\\\ns&=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum(x-\\bar x)^2}{n-1}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n### Example - Using the standard deviation \n\nThe following data are the distances (in miles) between 20 retail stores and a large distribution center: \n\n`29, 37, 38, 40, 58, 67, 68, 69, 76, 86, 87, 95, 96, 96, 99, 106, 112, 127, 145, 150`\n\na. Using a graphing calculator or computer to find the standard deviation of the distances rounded to the nearest tenth. \n\n\\vspace{3em}\n\nb. Find the value that is one standard deviation below the mean. \n\n\\vspace{3em}\n\n## Homework \n\n*Use the following information to answer the exercises* : The population parameters below describe the full-time equivalent number of students (FTES) each year at Lake Tahoe Community College from 1976-1977 through 2004-2005. \n\n* $\\mu=1000$ FTES \n* median $=1,014$ FTES \n* $\\sigma=474$ FTES \n* first quartile = $528.5$ FTES \n* third quartile = $1,447.5$ FTES \n* $n=29$ years \n\n1. A sample of 11 years is taken. About how many are expected to have an FTES of $1,014$ or above? Explain. \n\n\\vspace{4em}\n\n2. Seventy-five percent of all years have an FTES \n    a. at or below [             ]{.underline} \n    b. at or above [             ]{.underline} \n\n3. The population standard deviation is [             ]{.underline} \n\n4. What percentage of the FTES were from 528.5 to 1,447.5? How do you know? \n\n\\vspace{3em}\n\n5. What is the IQR? What does the IQR represent? \n\n6. How many standard deviations away from the mean is the median? \n\n\\vspace{4em}\n\n\\newpage\n\n## OPTIONAL READING - Why use n-1 in computing standard deviation? \n\nTo see the effect that using $n$ vs $n-1$ has in computing the sample standard deviation compared to the true population standard deviation, we can run a simulation as follows: \n\n1. Create a data set, for example `rnorm(100)` to create 100 values sample from a normal distribution. \n\n2. From this data, we can compute the true population standard deviation as $\\sigma^2=\\frac{\\sum(x-\\mu)^2}{N}$ \n\n3. We can then sample the population many times times and compare what the sample standard deviation is using the corrected ($n-1$) and uncorrected ($n$) standard deviation. \n\n**Step 1**: Create data set and then sample it\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse, quietly=TRUE)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Create data set\ndata <- data.frame(x=rnorm(100))\n\n# Sample data set 10,000 times and save result \nsamples <- purrr::map(1:10000, ~ sample(data$x, size = 10, replace = TRUE))\n\npaste(\"Example Sample 1:\"); samples[[1]]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"Example Sample 1:\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n [1] -0.09769492 -1.33756787 -0.30640682 -0.55977748  0.12597556  0.67927770\n [7] -0.39679075 -0.56364162  2.19380049 -0.48501557\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n**Step 2**: Compute true population standard deviation\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntrue_pop_var <- (sum((data$x - mean(data$x))^2) / length(data$x))\npaste(\"True population standard deviation:\"); sqrt(true_pop_var)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"True population standard deviation:\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1.108998\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n**Step 3**: Find corrected and uncorrected variance of each sample\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nuncorrected_var_each <- purrr::map_dbl(samples, ~ (sum((.x - mean(.x))^2) / (length(.x))))\ncorrected_var_each <- purrr::map_dbl(samples, ~ (sum((.x - mean(.x))^2) / (length(.x)-1)))\n\n# Creates data frames to store sample number, variance, correction, and standard deviation\nuncorr <- data.frame(sample_num=1:length(uncorrected_var_each),\n                     variances = uncorrected_var_each, \n                     Correction = rep(\"Uncorrected (n)\", length(uncorrected_var_each)), \n                     cumulative_mean_var= cummean(uncorrected_var_each)) %>%\n    mutate(stdev=sqrt(cumulative_mean_var))\ncorr <- data.frame(sample_num=1:length(corrected_var_each),\n                   variances = corrected_var_each, \n                   Correction = rep(\"Corrected (n-1)\", length(corrected_var_each)), \n                   cumulative_mean_var = cummean(corrected_var_each)) %>%\n    mutate(stdev=sqrt(cumulative_mean_var))\n\n# Combine data frames\nresult <- rbind(uncorr, corr)\nhead(result)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  sample_num variances      Correction cumulative_mean_var     stdev\n1          1 0.8150365 Uncorrected (n)           0.8150365 0.9027937\n2          2 2.0055404 Uncorrected (n)           1.4102884 1.1875557\n3          3 0.6079894 Uncorrected (n)           1.1428554 1.0690442\n4          4 1.2375521 Uncorrected (n)           1.1665296 1.0800600\n5          5 0.4359457 Uncorrected (n)           1.0204128 1.0101548\n6          6 1.0443874 Uncorrected (n)           1.0244086 1.0121307\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFinally, let's view the results.
