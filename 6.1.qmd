# The Standard Normal Distribution

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}

* Normal Distribution with mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1. 
    * $N(0,1)$
* Represents standardized scores called *$z$-scores*
* Used to indicate the number of standard deviations a score falls above (or below) the mean. 
* Allows of comparisons of scores across data sets
* A value in a normally distributed data set can be converted to a z-score with: 
    * $z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$
* Standard normal is written: $Z\sim N(0,1)$

:::

### Example

**Given a data set with $\mu = 4$ and $\sigma = 2$, how many standard deviations does a score of 10 fall above the mean? **

Find the $z$-score: 

$z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}=\frac{10-4}{2}=\mathbf{3}$

So a score of 10 falls 3 standard deviations above the mean 4. 

#### Question
**Given a data set with $\mu = 5$ and $\sigma = 3$, how many standard deviations does a score of 11 fall above the mean? **

## Z-Scores
Recall: 

* If $X$ is a normally distributed random variable then
    * $X \sim$
* And the $z$-score is: 
    * $z = \frac{\qquad}{\qquad}$
* The $z$-score tells you how many standard deviations above or below the mean a $x$-value falls. 

### Example  

**Given $X\sim N(5, 6)$ and $x = 17$**: Find the $z$-score. 

$$
\begin{aligned}
z&=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\\[5mm]
z&=\frac{\qquad}{\qquad}\\[5mm]
z&=
\end{aligned}
$$


This means that $x=17$ is _________ **standard deviations** ______ of the mean. 

### Question 1

What is the $z$-score of $x$, when $x=1$ and $X\sim N(12,3)$?

### Question 2

Jerome averages 16 points a game with a standard deviation of 4 points so $X\sim N(16,4)$. Suppose Jerome scores 10 points in a game, the $z$-score when $x=10$ is -1.5. This score tells you that $x=10$ is _______ standard deviations to the ________ (right or left) of the mean ________ (what is the mean?).

## The Empirical Rule  
IF $X$ is a random variable and has a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, then the **Empirical Rule states**:  

* About 68 percent of the $x$ values lie between $-1\sigma$ and $+1\sigma$ of the mean (within one standard deviation)
* About 95 percent of the $x$ values lie between $-2\sigma$ and $+2\sigma$ of the mean (within two standard deviations)
* About 99.7 percent of the $x$ values lie between $-3\sigma$ and $+3\sigma$ of the mean (within one standard deviation)

Also known as the *68-95-99.7* rule.

### Example  
The mean height of 15-18 year old males from Chile from 2009 to 2010 was 170 cm with a standard deviation of 6.28cm. Male heights are known to follow a normal distribution. Let $X=$ the height of a 15-18 year old from Chile in 2009-20010. Then $X\sim N(170,6.28)$

a. Suppose a 168cm male from is selected from Chile. THe $z$-score when $x=168$ cm is _________. This $z$-score tells you that $x=168$ is _________ standard deviations to the ________ (right or left) of the mean _______.
