{{< include preamble.qmd >}}

* **Box Plots**, also called **box-and-whisker plots**, give a good graphical image of the concentration of the data. 
* Also show how far the extreme values are from most of the data. 
* Constructed using the 5-number summary (min, $Q_1$, median, $Q_3$, and max)

Consider the data set: 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 6, 6.8, 7.2, 8, 8.3, 9, 10, 10, 11.5

```{r}
#| fig.height: 2

data <- data.frame(x = c(1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 6, 6.8, 7.2, 8, 8.3, 9, 10, 10, 11.5))

ggplot(data, aes(x = x)) + 
    geom_boxplot() + 
    theme_notes()
```
